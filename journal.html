    <h3 class=rtitles>Week of 10.19.2020:</h3>
    <p1 class=reflections>I finished my first codesketch of a spinning square transitioning from a sun to a moon and I am almost finished with my person card. I have learned some beginner aspects of Javascript, CSS, and HTML and started coding using what I learned. It has been interesting trying to apply it to my codesketch and also think about how I could use what we learn for my main project and website.</p1>
    <h4 class=rtitles>Week of 10.26.2020:</h4>
    <p2 class=reflections>This week I started to develop my personal website (this website)! So far I have create a menu bar (changes color when you hover and text changes color when you a specific page), started to develop my welcome page (with designing the j logo and to put it on the page by clicking), and I linked certain parts of the website to other pages (the parts of the menu bar to specific pages and clicking my name will get you back to the welcome page). I have also created the “Square Art” code sketch and along the way, I learned how to apply “else” and “else if” statements in Javascript. This week I also have been brainstorming a ton of ideas for my website so I can’t wait to keep on developing it further!</p2>
    <h5 class=rtitles>Week of 11.2.2020:</h5>
    <p3 class=reflections>For my welcome page, I am learning about arrays and working on a codesketch with them. I learned how to randomize a specific feature using what is listed in an array -- right now specifically with colors! I also started drawing animal buddies for it and other icons that will be incorporated into my website.</p3>
    <h6 class=rtitles>Week of 11.9.2020:</h6>
    <p4 class=reflections>I created a drop down menu for my codesketch to go back to the main menu which I really like as it doesn’t take up space when looking at the page. So far for my array codesketch, the challenges that I have encountered is styling things that are being referred to in the script section of the body (since it is in javascript instead of css). But I really enjoy this codesketch and am really excited for the finished project!</p4>
    <br>

    <h7 class="rtitles">Week of 11.16.2020:</h7>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p5 class=reflections>I worked on figuring out how to apply arrays to my welcome page. I have come to some roadblocks with this and some issues have arisen so I have to continue working on this next week. I got it so that the js disappeared after 5 clicks but am planning on having the js transition. I also brainstormed a codesketch for the thanksgiving gratitude card assignment. </p5>
    <br>

    <h8 class="rtitles">Week of 12.14.2020:</h8>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p6 class=reflections>This week during labs I completed my transition on my welcome page of moving the js to the center! I used arrays and style to transition the js after a certain number of them were displayed. This week I also began drawing the icons for my home page. I also worked on a group codesketch (forloops)!</p6>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h9 class="rtitles">Week of 1.11.2021:</h9>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p7 class=reflections>After break, I mocked up and finished icons for my home page and started to implement them.</p7>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h10 class="rtitles">Week of 1.19.2021:</h10>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p8 class=reflections>The Data Project assignment was announced. This week I started to brainstorm my project -- which in it, I wanted to include scroll event listeners and music. I also created a draft sheet of what I want each scroll page to look like and started to make a plan for how to create it (The Music Data Codesketch).</p8>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h11 class="rtitles">Week of 2.1.2021:</h11>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p9 class=reflections>This week I created a codesketch with dots to help me with my Music Data Codesketch and when you refresh the page, the positions of the dots change (as they are randomized -- but within the confines of the color column). In addition I added a fun interactive aspect, when you click on any of the dots, it will randomize its color to one of the three. </p9>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h12 class="rtitles">Week of 2.8.2021:</h12>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p10 class=reflections>This week I pushed a big update on my welcome page! After the Js collected in one spot I decided that was a bit too random so when the viewer clicks a few more times it will eventually say welcome!</p10>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h13 class="rtitles">Week of 2.22.2021:</h13>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p11 class=reflections>This week I am trying to work out how to get my dots to move into a certain div when you scroll to a certain spot in labs and for the dots to continue to move. Although we encountered some trouble, the dots were able to move but then they were stationary and didn’t have their rattle/dancy movement. 
    </p11>

    <br>
    <h14 class="rtitles">Week of 3.1.2021:</h14>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p12 class=reflections>This week and this past week, I have inserted a section of my music data project which allows the viewer to be able to listen to songs when you are scrolling through. Also for convenience since the top of the page isn’t done, on the top right I created a jump to music section that brings you further down the page and closer to listening to music!!! Also there is a pause button underneath the “jump to music button” which comes in handy! Overall I really am enjoying working on this project and loving how its turning out. This is one of my more complicated projects and you can check my slideshow presentation where I list what comp sci skills I used to create it. (side note: if the music doesn't align with the title of the song it's because your window size is a different size than mine-- I will hopefully learn how to fix it in the future!)

    <h15 class="rtitles">Week of 3.8.2021:</h15>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p13 class=reflections>This week I focused on my CS1 Story Presentation (that I ended up presenting on friday). I used reveal.js which involved coding but involved pre programmed features which was cool to work with. At first it was hard to come up with a story but I’m really happy with my presentation (because of the combo of the actual slides, my speaking part, and the story itself). And the slideshows were also a bit confusing at first because of the sub section but after I got the hang of it and did some research I ended up with a presentation I really like! If you want, you can check it out, as it should be able to see it underneath my codesketches!

    <h16 class="rtitles">Week of 3.15.2021</h16>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p14 class=reflections>This week is the last week of CS1 :(.  This is probably my favorite class this year, as I learned to get involved in coding, and was able to express my ideas exactly on the page. I really enjoyed taking this class with Molly (Ms. Josephs) because the labs were extremely helpful for focussing on my individual questions/codesketches. I had a great experience in this class and I can’t wait to continue coding in the future!!!
